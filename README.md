# Ethereum DApps

This repo holds the code to create Ethereum DApps using Solidity, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) framework is used for development and testing purposes. The frontend web application uses [Web3.js](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js) API for interacting with the blockchain.

The repo describes the code written while learning from free YouTube tutorial [Build 5 Dapps on the Ethereum Blockchain - Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wMKq7HvbKw&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) by [freeCodeCamp.org]('https://www.freeCodeCamp.org').

The tutorial shows 5 different DApps built on top of Ethereum blockchain. I have created a different branch for holding the code related to each one of them.

The `main` branch acts as a starting point for each project and any future projects to come. It is a simple project created with `truffle init`

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```
/
  contracts
    Migrations.sol
    ...
  migrations
    1_initial_migration.js
    ...
  test
    ...
  Readme.md
  truffle-config.js
```

The `contracts` folder holds the smart contracts to be deployed and used. These contracts are written in Solidity, thus having `.sol` extension

The `migrations` folder holds the code required for compiling and deploying the contracts. Once compiled, they generate smart contract artifacts, which are JSON objects representing the contract.

The `public` folder is the one used for frontend app. The website to be displayed to the user is located in this folder and served using `serve` package.

The `test` folder is useful for testing the smart contracts. The tests are necessary to find & mitigate potenstial risks before the app is deployed onto the blockchain.

## Installation

- Install `truffle` as a global repository

  ```bash
  npm install -g truffle
  ```

- Clone the repository

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/3atharvkurdukar/ethereum-dapps.git
  ```

## Development

To start the development server, enter the following command:

```bash
truffle develop
```

This will create a development environment. A local blockchain will be created, along with 10 private key & public key combinations to test with.
The development enviropnment allows us to deploy smart contracts to the local blockchain without signing them.

Once the blockchain has been created, a prompt will appear:

```bash
truffle(develop)>
```

The commands related to the development can be entered in the prompt.

In order to deploy the smart contract, enter:

```bash
truffle(develop)> migrate --hard
```

This will build the smart contract artifacts & deploy them on the blockchain. The `--hard` flag ensures that the artifacts generated by the previous folder are replaced by new artifacts.

## Testing

To test the smart contract, enter:

```bash
truffle test
```
